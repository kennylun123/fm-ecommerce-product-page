## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

- Server and Client Components
- Conditional rendering
- Context API (Cart provider)
- Lightbox
- Image Slider

### Useful resources

- [NextJS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) - This helped me for the concept of dividing the server and client side components.
- [How to use React Context with useState](https://medium.com/comsystoreply/how-to-use-react-context-with-usestate-c8ae4fe72fb9) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand React Context with practicle examples. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [Simple React Image Slider](https://codesandbox.io/s/simple-react-image-slider-t68xrq?file=/src/slider.css) - This is a simple example that I built on CodeSandBox which helped to understand the idea of making a image slider.
